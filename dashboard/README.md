# Dashboard & Account Overview

## Scope
The Dashboard is the central hub of the Viio application. It provides users with a real-time summary of their assets, recent movements, and quick access to all primary financial operations.

## Flow Details
1.  **Balance Visualization**:
    *   The `balanceManager` synchronizes with the backend to display the user's total equity in their preferred base currency (e.g., USD/COP).
2.  **Recent Movements**:
    *   A snapshot of the latest transactions is fetched via `transactionsManager`, providing immediate visibility into account activity.
3.  **Navigation Hub**:
    *   Strategic routing to Deposit, Transfer, Withdrawal, and Card modules.
